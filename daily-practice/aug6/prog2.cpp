/*
Anukampa decided to buy a new tablet.
His budget is B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than B.
Other than that, he only has one criterion â€” the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible.
Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.
Anukampa has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options.
In total, there are N available tablets, numbered 1 through N.
For each valid i, the i-th tablet has width Wi, height Hi and price Pi.
Help Anukampa choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.
Diplay "No tablet" if he cannot buy any tablet.
